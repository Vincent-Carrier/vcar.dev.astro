JavaScript iterators are one of my favourite features of the language, yet nobody seems to know about them. Used well, they can make your code clearer, decoupled, and more memory-efficient.

Glad you asked. An **Iterator** is, simply put, an object which lets us loop through some values. Its signature looks more or less like this:

```typescript
interface Iterator<T> {
  next(): { value: T; done: boolean }
}
```

This is a low-level protocol, not something you generally interact with as a programmer. In contrast, the **Iterable** protocol is something you exploit every day. Whenever you use `for (let item of something)`, you take advantage of the fact that `something` is an Iterable. That `something` can be a string, an array, even your own objects. The only requirement is that it should have a `[Symbol.iterator]` function returning an Iterator object.

The simplest way to create an Iterable is to write a **generator function**:

```js
function* simpleGenerator() {
  yield 1
  yield 2
  yield 3
}

let iterable = simpleGenerator()

for (let n of iterable) {
  console.log(n) // => 1 2 3
}
```

An important side note: the result of a generator function implements both the Iterable _and_ the Iterator protocols.

## Wait, what's that little asterisk? What's that `yield` thing?

Just like `async` tells the JavaScript parser "This functions returns a `Promise`. BTW, it may use the `await` keyword.", the asterisk tells the parser "Hey, this function is a generator. It returns an Iterable. It may use `yield` within its body."

`yield` tells the for-of loop "Here's your next thing. Have fun with it. Come back to me when you need some more." The important thing to remember is that `yield` **does not terminate the function** like `return` would, but merely suspends its execution until the next for-loop iteration.

## What else can you do with them?

A ton of things, actually. Some [Lodash](http://lodash.com) utilities are trivial to implement with generators. Here's a few of my favourites:

<div class="flex gap-x-4 -mx-8 px-16 h-72 overflow-x-auto">
  ```js
  function* range(from, to, step = 1) {
    for (let i = from; i <= to; i += step) {
      yield i
    }
  }

  console.log([...range(4, 10, 2)])
  // => [4, 6, 8, 10]
  ```
  ```js
  function* take(iterable, max) {
    let i = 0
    for (let next of iterable) {
      if (i < max) yield next
      else return
      i++
    }
  }

  console.log([...take(range(4, 10, 2), 2)])
  // => [4, 6]
  ```
</div>
You could even [implement your own React-like framework](https://crank.js.org/) on top of Iterables, effectively treating the DOM as a render loop.

## You mentioned `yield*` earlier. What's that about?

`yield*` is like the `yield` keyword, but is used with Iterables instead of plain values. This lets us compose generator functions together in a very natural way:

```js
function* times(n) {
  yield* range(0, n - 1)
}

console.log([...times(4)])
// => [0, 1, 2, 3]
```

## So, are Iterables just, like... arrays?

Eh... not quite. An `Array` _is_ an Iterable, but not all Iterables are `Array`s. The main difference is that **Iterators are lazy**. They only compute the next element when explicitly asked. This makes them a great fit for, say, computing the thousandth element of the Fibonacci sequence.

```js
function* fibonacci() {
  let current = 0,
    next = 1
  while (true) {
    yield current
    ;[current, next] = [next, next + current]
  }
}

const iterator = fibonacci()
for (let i = 0; i < 999; i++) {
  // looping "manually"
  iterator.next()
}

console.log(iterator.next().value)
// => 2.686381002448534e+208
```

While this may take some compute power, it doesn't bog down our precious RAM with numbers we may no longer care about. This is a pretty trivial example but, in a real-world scenario, you might even be able to fit the entire `Array` in memory.

We can always convert an Iterable to an `Array`, using `Array.from()` or the spread operator.

```js
console.log(Array.from(take(fibonacci(), 6)))
// => [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5]
console.log([...take(fibonacci(), 6)])
// => [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5]
```

## You said something about making your own objects Iterables?

Right! We just need to implement `[Symbol.iterator]`. Here's what that would look like in practice:

```js
let ticTacToe = {
  grid: [
    ['X', 'O', '_'],
    ['O', '_', '_'],
    ['_', '_', 'X'],
  ],
  *[Symbol.iterator]() {
    for (let y = 0; y < 3; y++) {
      yield* this.grid[y]
    }
  },
}

for (let cell of ticTacToe) {
  console.log(cell)
  // => X O _ O _ ...
}
```

<hr/>

I hope you can see now how Iterators, Iterables and generators let us write code that is more scalable, more expressive, and more maintainable.
